# Introduction:

During this project, the main goal is to implement researched and tested commercially used 3D modelling software's and techniques, as well manufacturing processes and abilities at disposal. Using these methods, the aim is to produce a simple animatronic that can perform dances and movements as well as play songs and voice lines. Specifically, within this project, a recreation of an existing character model using these techniques will be produced. The development process to this project will be documented here whilst critically analysing the result as well as the processes used to create it. A range of technologies and software's that can be used will be researched and decided against with a development stage to the artefact and an overall conclusion.

# Technologies:

A range of technologies were investigated and tested and where mostly capable of being used towards the project, within this section is the reasoning for the chosen technologies and their explanation as well as the technologies that weren't included and the reasoning behind those decisions.

## 3D Modelling and design methods:

### 3D scanning:

3D scanning (Natalia Kivolya, June 2019) is a process that uses lasers and line of sight against points of a physical object to map out and recreate the geometry and shape of the object within software by analysing its 3-dimensional shape and using the distances picked up from the lasers. The aim of this is to create a 3d model replica of an existing object or environment. The software and drivers used are specialised to work with the scanners an example being "GOM Inspect". These software's are extremely well designed to convert the information created from the scanners into a 3d model that can be converted to STL for serval uses such as printing. Advantages being its highly effective and efficient and creating highly detailed models even to large sizes. The disadvantages being there has to be a model or object to scan and replicate which can come at high costs to rent or acquire. Without access and funding to an existing model for the project this process cannot be implemented.

### Motion Capture:

Motion capture (Animost, March 2022) is the process of recording the movements of people or objects through the use of optical, similar to 3D scanning by using points created by markers to track and map out the motion of the markers, this allows for more realistic movement. The movements are processed and can be used for applications such as animation and game development, or within movies and film creation, with animatronics it can be used to program better and more realistic movement. The advantages of this is with the use of software and cameras, precise and accurate tracking can recreate precise movements and animation effectively and save a lot of time from those processes, this also reduces costs. However, it relies on specialised software and becomes more expensive and inefficient for smaller projects. It also needs a large active workspace to perform in. The animatronic made from this project will have simplistic movements and would be excessive and time costly to implement these processes to the project.

### Haptic Sculpting:

Haptic input hardware and associated 3d sculpting software is hardware designed to recreate force feedback and using pivots and arms to measure the geometry changes performed, this is used to alter 3D modelling software with the precision performed with the hardware. This allows for sculpting 3D models and with the required skills can produce highly detailed 3D models and designs. The advantages of this are the ability to make highly detailed and accurate models to the uses needs whilst being more efficient than traditional means depending on the model and skill of the user. The disadvantages however are that a reliable amount of skill and time is required to produce worthwhile results. This could be a viable process within the project such as creating Yoda's head, however this model was outsourced for the project and removes the use of haptic sculpting.

### 3D Printing:

This process (Twi-Global, Twi Global Research Association/Institute)is making 3-dimensional solid objects from digital files using layering certain materials until the object is produced. This can use a certain range of materials for different outcomes and produce both efficient and automatic results, or slow but highly detailed objects. The advantages to this are it can produce objects straight from digital files, it can be setup as an automatic process with the right 3D printers, its cost effective with a standardised material, minimise waste through making parts and works well with rapid prototyping. The disadvantages to this are the limited range of materials making them most unrecyclable or may not fit the requirements, the restricted build size from the printer used and post processing is relied upon. This process will be the main process within the development and building of the artefact for this project, this is because it allows for easier and quicker development and testing of parts whilst allowing the use of CAD software to design the hinges effectively.

### Laser Cutting:

Laser cutting (Twi Global Research Association/Institute) is the process of using a high-powered laser directed through optics and computer numerical control to direct the laser at certain materials. This has the capability to etch designs into materials or cut martials precisely. Advantages of this process are its a highly precise, accurate and reliable method of cutting certain materials to shapes and designs as well as implementing those designs onto those materials. Its also repeatable and automatable making efficient for manufacturing. The draw backs are the need of expertise, costs for materials and the machines required and dangerous fumes that is produced from certain materials. This is used within the project to create the stands for the Yoda and to engrave words into the stands created.

### Resing Casting:

Resin casting (OneMonroe, August 2019) is the process of using synthetic resin that's converted into rigid polymers by creating a mould and filling the mould with the two substances being mixed. The curing agent is what convers the resin to polymers and hardens it, the hardened casting is them removed from the mould cavity leaving a strong object created with the benefits created from the substances mixed. The benefits being it's a simple process with basic requirements whilst being able to produce strong complex shapes. Disadvantages being its inefficient for manufacturing processes and the produced object typically has very fuses uses before it fails. Also, certain health concerns with the use of synthetic resin. Within the project this could be used to strengthen certain joints or build the body however is an unnecessary process for our design.

## CAD Software:

Cad standing for computer aided design refers to software used for different levels of digital creation for both 3D and 2D design, there are many varieties of software existing for different purposes and this section will explain the selection used or decided against within this project.

### Fusion 360:

Fusion 360 is a well designed and effective 2D and 3D modelling software with many practical features for users to effectively create and display models. This works well for team building projects and is able to create manufacturing standard designs and models, despite how useful this software is and the range of capabilities, it can be over complicated and reduce the efficiency of creating and changing parts whilst also requiring a decent amount of processing power so this was decided against within the project.

### AutoDesk123D:

AutoDesk is a discontinued software that wouldn't meet the current standards for industry level modelling and design, this program flaws like needing certain versions and being difficult to acquire as well as having outdated systems and capabilities has its own benefits. This software is a lot simpler and effective when it comes to 3D design and allows for the creation of complicated models to be created more fluently whilst also using less processing power making it a quicker process from design to production and testing the prints.

### Blender:

Blender is a long running industry standard 3D modelling software that has been free and reliable since its creation. This has an extremely wide range of capabilities from building animations to models for video game development. This software allows for highly detailed and high-resolution creations as well as providing a range of purchasable and free assets. However, this software requires a moderate amount of skill to use effectively and is slower from creation to production as well as also requiring a decent amount of processing power, so it was decided against for this project.

### Mesh Mixer:

Mesh mixer is from the same branch as 123D and can be used to edit and create high resolution models with more additional sculpting features, despite being discontinued this software paring this with 123D creates an entire modelling creation to slicing system making it design to production stage as efficient as possible and iterations of parts can be made and changed effectively. Access to this software is limited but still attainable so despite this software not meeting current industry standards it was decided to be used for its efficiency and simplicity for the model's creation.

# Concept:

There are two specific key focus points the project will implement for the product to be completed which is a skin-based element, which can be based off the materials used or the texture provided such as latex printing, and a hinge element which will be designed in the 3d printing process.

The chosen character to recreate is called "yoda" due to current trends at the beginning of this project but also being a well-known character, which already has animatronics designed on an industry scale making it applicable to a business standard. The decision was to make an animatronic version of this character that could simulate dancing with the use of motors and hinges on appendages to the character.

The project specification:

To consider this project a success and analyse the results produced a MOSCOW representation of the specification will be used to depict what must, should and could be included. This will represent the core fundamentals to the project, the desirables and what could be done for further enhancement.

Must:

Skin element incorporated to the animatronic through either material used or the texture created onto the parts.

Hinged mechanism which will be a core function in the design, this will be used to enable the movement of the animatronic

Should:

Sero Motors embedded into the joints/hinges created to simulate movement, expected to be 3 servo motors on budget restrictions.

Micro controller, the micro controller will enable the use of the servo motors and create programmable movements for the animatronic

Could:

MP3 Audio Playing Capabilities, using a speaker to allow the use of storing and playing both songs and voice lines

Would:

If the project was commercially made and to an industry standard, wheels could be used to allow for positional movement for the animatronic and allow for better interactivity.

# Hardware Considerations:

Implementing movement within the artefact requires electronics and software being applied, this section will explain the hardware used to create both the movement and audio of the artefact

## Hardware:

To make the model programmable, a processing element will be applied, this can be done through various means including micro controllers, raspberry pi's and Arduino's. The hardware selected for this project will be Arduinos, this is because they use simple and accessible software that can be dynamically implemented to control electrical systems, since the program will use servo motors, motors and potentially speakers, Arduinos provide the best efficiency and cost effectiveness for development of the artefact. Raspberry pi's are more expensive and house excessive processing power and capabilities for this project and micro controllers require both interpreters and methods of putting the code onto them making it inefficient for development despite being cheaper.

Hardware Costs:

| Component | Quantity | Cost / unit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Arduino Uno | 1 | £10-15 |
| Servo Motors | 3 | £3-5 |
| MP3 module | 1 | £5-6 |
| Speaker | 1-2 | £4-5 |


# Design Concepts:

Starting the project will require an overview of the elements that will be required to effectively design and build the artefact. This section will go over and explain the technologies or methods being used and their reasoning.

Design methods and software choices:

## Auto Desk 123D:

This program was used to create most assets the model is built with due to its simplistic design allowing for quicker creation of models and allowing for more file types to be supported creating more reliability if other practices where required.

## Mesh Mixer:

Mesh mixer allows for higher quality and higher resolution for more complicated components to be designed without the limitations provided by the simpler software, this software also allows for more compliance to manufacturing standards for more reliable production.

## Cura:

Cura is the middleman between 3D modelling and printing, this slicer allows the 3D model files to be converted directly into the file type and structure require for printing, it also allows for last minute sizing and changes whilst providing full control over printing settings and results of the model, this also allows to print in higher quality and detail using smaller layer sizes which improves the models results.

## Arduino:

The software for Arduinos is a simple and efficient program allowing for direct upload and editing of code straight to Arduinos making it effective and necessary to the project.

## Adobe Illustrator:

Illustrator is used for the design and preparation for laser cutting to create the stands to the artefact, this allows for efficient and simple application of the laser cutting machines.

# Design:

The base design or the model comprised of a using the microcontroller (which was going to be necessary for movement) as the structural support/endo skeleton with a custom support/frame that the microcontroller would fit on, this frame would act as the main stand to the artefact, with the microcontroller connecting all the elements together at the body. This was a risky design but works well at reducing the resources needed to produce it. The skin aspect is achieved by using the layering created through 3d printing to produce texture to the parts that would be created, with the parts being designed as their respective body parts to the character matching his skin colour to create the illusion of skin through the design.

Hinges being a core feature to the artefact was aimed towards to the joints and appendages to the character, this consisting of the arms that would be connected through servo motors at the shoulders of the character, and another servo motor connecting the head to the body (body being microcontroller). With the hinges being the elbows on the arms, this allows for head rotation on the X axis, the shoulders to have rotation along the y axis, ad the hinges allowing the elbows to also rotate on the y axis.

## Development of artefact:

Keeping the design simple and easy to print, led to a total of 7 parts, 6 that where 3d printed and designed for the model and 1 being the micro controller, these parts all assemble to produce the artefact entirely.

- Head x1 (Organic)
- Left Hand x1 (Organic)
- Right Hand x1 (Organic)
- Upper body x1 (Functional)
- Lower body x1 (Functional)
- Arms x2 (Functional)

| Part | Count | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Head | 1x | Organic |
| Left Hand | 1x | Organic |
| Right Hand | 1x | Organic |
| Upper Body | 1x | Functional |
| Lower Body | 1x | Functional |
| Arms | 2x | Functional |

These parts ore comprised of functional components (Components to aid the structure of the model) and organic components (Designed to look like skin and match the character). Using Mesh Mixer, the organic parts for the body were created as it allows for a high resolution for both the design and printing to make the outcome match the skin like detail and doesn't require difficult integration through its connections for assembly. 123D was used for a better ability for development of the integration by production method parameters.

The main upper and lower body parts required more planning due to meticulously measuring distances and sizes of the servos and Arduino to that would be required to construct the pieces together as well as holes for screws to hold it all into place. The lower body design was created with a hexagonal row of holes through the centre, this allowed for easy access for wiring and saves material and weight.

With one of the core focuses being around joints, the arms are the complex models with several stages of development required. This will be stages from creating an arm that meets the required size and metrics, up until its developed enough to have a joint and can rotate on an axis. The requirements for the arm is to be able to rotate around a point (that being the elbow) and being able to attach to the body through a motor, as well as having a stable base to attach the hands to.

Arm Development:

### Version 1:

![]([RackMultipart20230526-1-7ohvgs_html_4821d0de579b34dd.png](https://github.com/UniUserBW/UniUserBw.github.io/blob/1250356a323f7a6e8cc28b05bc43149229f54617/parts_images/ARMV1.PNG)) 
![](https://github.com/UniUserBW/UniUserBw.github.io/blob/1250356a323f7a6e8cc28b05bc43149229f54617/parts_images/ARM%203.png)
The first stage of the arm is strictly to create a design that fits in place to the body, whilst extending to appoint where a hand could be attached to the end.

This served as the base foundation to developing the arm, its clear where a hinge could be applied to add movement to the arm and the contact points are made at the ends, the character being created does not follow normal human body dimensions, so this arm is completely designed as a test. The changes made from the production of the basic arm was a more rigid design, since the hinge and arm is going to be two sections connected, the shape of the arm needed to me a straighter alignment to add hinges effectively unlike the curved basis of the previous version. This had its proportions matched to the rest of the body parts. The main change required is implementing the hinge in the next version.

## Version 2:

![](https://github.com/UniUserBW/UniUserBw.github.io/blob/1250356a323f7a6e8cc28b05bc43149229f54617/parts_images/ARM%204.png)
This version meets the criteria the arm needed to achieve, with the implementation of a hinge which is a print in place hinge when 3d printing and a complete redesign of the outline and making it essentially two parts connected through the hinge, this part continues to use the same dimensions whilst having less filled in to save money and filament within the printing process. This allows the arm to pivot and rotate at the joint of the elbow which will allow the animatronic to recreate dancing and movement using the motors. Printing both pieces together and as a connected joint allow for quicker and simpler assembly and makes testing more efficient.

## Final Version:

![](https://github.com/UniUserBW/UniUserBw.github.io/blob/1250356a323f7a6e8cc28b05bc43149229f54617/parts_images/ARM%205.png)
The final version of the arm keeps hinge/joint system created in version 4 but changes the geometry of the arm by shortening what would be the arm to the animatronic, this creates a more realistic proportion of the arm.

# Artefact creation:

With the development applied to the arm as well as the main upper and lower body pieces constructed into 3D models, the main software elements have been achieved and will need to be created into a prototype.

## Production Mediums:

With the main parts constructed with 3D printing in mind 3D printing would be the main means to creating the parts to the prototype, this allows for quick and efficient development with little waste as 3D printing the parts can all be done at once. This would be the required method with the print in place hinge as this wouldn't be achievable through this design within other methods. The decision of material was PLA as it's a relatively cheap material with the safest properties for both environmental impacts and fumes etc. from the other alternatives, this material is also the most universal for usage as it requires a lower melting temperature but still provides solid and study prints with its usage being simpler it makes for better chances to create more accurate prints.

This method was chosen over the use of SLA and resin as these processes would be significantly longer with a higher chance to cause issues or fail, these methods also don't allow for the same changes that can be made to PLA due to the materials brittleness.

## Prototype Development:

With all the parts designed and the method of production decided, the prototype was to be developed through printing all the parts, assembling the printed parts with the motors and Arduino, coding the Arduino to implement the movement to the animatronic, designing the stands and possible outfits for the animatronic.

The head being created first was successful with printing, following this the upper and lower body where created, alongside the two arms and hands, these are the main components to assemble as the rest attaches to these pieces and the construct they main foundation to the artefact.

With the aim of potentially adding sound/speakers to the animatronic for music and phrase was going to be important, after the assembly of the motors and with the main body and head, a piezo buzzer was added to the chest of the animatronic which allows for simple manipulation of hertz to create sounds and show how speakers would be used.

From constructing the body to the head and implementing the hardware, it was clear the structure held well with the artefact supporting its own weight and standing on its own, the motors and parts fitting into place and the Arduino implemented onto the main body holding the lower and upper body parts together successfully, the next stages could progress.

The next stages include creating both clothing for the animatronic that would match the characters iconic clothing and painting to make the colours match the character.

![](https://github.com/UniUserBW/UniUserBw.github.io/blob/1250356a323f7a6e8cc28b05bc43149229f54617/yoda_images/Yoda%203.png)

The main outfit was constructed to match the character using felt and a woven belt, this added make it look more realistic to the character and worked to hide the motors, speaker and Arduino. Following this the character was painted to meet the colour pallet that the character is created with.

![](https://github.com/UniUserBW/UniUserBw.github.io/blob/1250356a323f7a6e8cc28b05bc43149229f54617/yoda_images/Yoda%205.png)

Whilst the result of this did make the animatronic match the character more closely, the colour pallet was inaccurate and would require more testing and painting trails to match the character more effectively. The character is well known to use a walking stick which was also created and implemented to the artefact.

![](https://github.com/UniUserBW/UniUserBw.github.io/blob/1250356a323f7a6e8cc28b05bc43149229f54617/document_images/9bf70391-1ad0-472f-86fc-234fd1a91422.jpg)

During the development of the characters clothing being more realistic, the movement capabilities using the Arduino software were worked on to improve the range of motion and possible dance moves that could be performed by the artefact. A base was added from laser cutting acrylic alongside writing of "star wars" being engraved into the base which offered more support for movement as well as adding to the design. This made the model more stable and fixed a problem where the model could fall over during certain movements.

The colour palette design was improved with a lightsaber and different materials for clothing being used to match the colours the character wears being implemented; the colour palette was also made to be more realistic to the character using different paints to the previously used ones.

![](https://github.com/UniUserBW/UniUserBw.github.io/blob/1250356a323f7a6e8cc28b05bc43149229f54617/yoda_images/yoda.jpg)

After the remake of the characters outfit and the change of colours being applied, also with the movements being finished the next step was using the buzzer within the chest of the animatronic to play music and sounds that matched the character. Using an external system called "DF Player Pro", a little device that allowed the storage of mp3 audio files and could be connected to the Arduino, sound files could be directly uploaded and saved and played through the buzzer.

![](https://github.com/UniUserBW/UniUserBw.github.io/blob/1250356a323f7a6e8cc28b05bc43149229f54617/yoda_images/Three%20Yodas.png)

## Artefact Analysis:

The result was having 3 prototype versions using different motor systems to universally work through production and making it more attuned for real manufacturing, this allows for a different selection of hardware such as different motors to be used as shown with regular motors and servo motors. This resulted in a stable animatronic that could play sounds and voice lines through speakers, being able to perform different dance moves and motions and an artefact that very closely resembled the character being created.

# Conclusion:

The project ends with a deep understanding of a range of technologies and means of production being learned despite not all being used to create the artefact. The artefact showed clear use of 3D printing and the development of the parts used as well as covered the aims and objectives targeted almost perfectly. This model using 3D printing and the parts used could be made within a manufacturing process and would work as a real animatronic with the ability to be scaled up or down with minor changes being required.

Understanding of 3D modelling software and their uses was heavily reinforced with a deeper look into designs such as hinges and connections that could be made through these means. The result provided an animatronic that met the criteria made for development with the capabilities of dancing and general movements, with signing and playing songs whilst being directly designed for the character being created and was overall a successful artefact. If more time was allocated to this project, improvements that could be made would be changing the use of Arduinos to micro processors to allow for better scalability of the animatronic and possible use of latex as the martial for skin.
